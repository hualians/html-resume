<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>During my time in college, I gained experience writing research papers, which greatly honed my critical thinking and analysis skills. Reading many articles on a variety of psychology-related topics helped me to sharpen my ability to synthesize information into comprehensive points while also seeing the bigger picture. I also had the opportunity to conduct multiple research studies employing a variety of skills from survey creation to data collection and data analysis.</p>
    
<p>In addition, my current work experience has honed my skills in working with populations being studied as well as administering surveys over the phone via reading verbatim. This wide range of skills makes me suited to a variety of research-related activities.</p>
